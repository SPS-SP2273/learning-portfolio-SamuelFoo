This can be as mundane as renaming a set of files or more involved, like running the same statistical analysis on many experimental data sets. While humans quickly become tired (and bored) with such tasks, computers excel at mindless repetitive tasks. This section will show you how to repeat things in Python. This topic is called loops or iterations and is one of the most valuable features of any programming language.\n","\n","Python offers two mechanisms for looping. One is the for statement, and the other is the while statement.
